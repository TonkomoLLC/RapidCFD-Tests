Test cases for RapidCFD

- cavity - basic icoFoam test. Prepared in reply to https://github.com/Atizar/RapidCFD-dev/issues/44?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container

- coil-pisoFoam. Speed test for RapidCFD. Kindly prepared by and submitted by [Chengtun](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/members/chengtun.html) in response to the discussion found on [CFD-Online](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-community-contributions/170410-discussion-thread-how-install-use-rapidcfd-3.html)  - see posts #54-57.

- damBreak-rapidCFD. Test that I used to initially test RapidCFD (using a GeForce GTX 980M). 
The idea for a Dam Break test was inspired by [this](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-installation/178078-comparison-openfoam-i7-xeon-32-cores-xeon-phi-knights-landing-tesla-k20m.html) CFD-Online posting by [ma-tri-x](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/members/ma-tri-x.html). Nvidia-smi output and the log file for the run are included. Test was stopped at ~0.402 seconds.
